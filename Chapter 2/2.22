This does not work because In the state variable area where hes defining
What answers should become he says (cons (square (car things)) answer)
So this automatiaclly puts the new item at the start of the list
when it should be at the end of the list 

The second one when you keep the list at the first and then the value
You create a nested list its a syntax thign

1 ]=> (cons 1 2)

;Value 11: (1 . 2)

1 ]=> (cons 1 (list 2 3))

;Value 12: (1 2 3)

1 ]=> (cons (list 2 3) 1)

;Value 13: ((2 3) . 1)


this is the syntax that messes things up
