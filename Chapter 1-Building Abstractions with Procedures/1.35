 golden ratio is defined as (I will be using o to represent golden ratio)

o^2= o+ 1 ;divide both sides by o
o= 1+ 1/o  

Substituing o for x  into the transformation:
1 + 1/o -> 1 + 1(1+ 1/o)
We can subtitute the o in the left handside for its definition
1 + 1/1 + 1/o 

this is equal to RHS

Therfore it is a fixed point of the function



(fixed-point (lambda (x)(+ 1 (/ 1 x))) 1)
result 1 377/610 (accurate)
