a. 12.15/3x<0.1
12.15/3<x/10
12.15*10/3<x
121.5/3<x
41 times 

ahhh so what i did wrong was that the number of times 
p is /3x it is /3^x because you continously divide the same
thing by there

Then the problem is easier to do using tracing

which gives the answer 5

space know becomes interesting
btw this     is linear recursive not tree recursive



space

Obviously as a gets larger you need more steps to divide it down 
to a number less then 0.1. This is linear 
0(a)

steps
I  know this a tree recursive process so the answer 
must be something exponential

I will draw tree diagrams with some values of A and see whats up

So i found out that the number of nodes is equal to 
2n + 1 where n is equal to the number of times we need to
 divide the number for it to be less than 0.1

And this n grows linearly as a grows so our answer for 
steps is 

0(a)
