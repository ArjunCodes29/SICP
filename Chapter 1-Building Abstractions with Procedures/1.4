So the procedural abstraction a plus abs b takes two formal parameters
a and b  
Then it uses an if statement as the operator
if b is positive then the if statement returns
true and returns the + which becomes the operator 
and adds a and b 
if b is negative then the expressions evaluates to false
which results in - being chosen and thus substracting a from - b 
which is the same as adding a to the abs value of b 
since b is negative
