Very small numbers
Tracing code with small numbers
guess=1.0
x=0.000001
answer=0.001

first good enough
1-0.000001 < 0.001
false so 

first improve guess
1+0.00001 ~ 0.5

0.25-0.00001 <0.001 is false
so 

improve again
/ (0.5+0.00002) 2
~0.25

onw this also doesnt works

so we repeat
0.125

0.06->0.036-0.000001
0.03->
0.0015

Basicallly the answer to the square root is very small and the 
tolerance is not small enough to get any sort of accurate answer

Very large numbers
x=1,000,000
guess=1

round 1
good enough
no doesnt work number is too large

improve guess
new guess becomes 500,000.5


round 2
good enough
does not work the number is way too large

improve guess
500,000.5+1,000,000/500,000.5
250001.249999

again number too large to pass good enough

round 3
250001.249999+1,000,000/250001.249999
 becomes 125000

 IM really not seeing an issue here it just keeps becoming smaller

# this one is super complex
but i think im understanding it when i saw the answer
basically 0.0001 is too little for the large numbers
as before getting close enough when u do the improve guess
u get the same result as the before guess
becuase of lack of preciision or something
so you can keep going until the change between
 guess and improve guess is very small
 its complex
