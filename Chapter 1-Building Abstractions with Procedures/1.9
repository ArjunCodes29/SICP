First one
(+ 4 5 )
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc  ( 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc  ( 6))))
(inc (inc  ( 7)))
(inc   ( 8))
9

So this is definitly recursive with the inc or the + 1 operations 
acting as the deffered operations which we like put to till later
It is also linearly recursive with the steps and the memory needed being
directly proportional to the value of a.

Second one
(+ 4 5 )
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
(+ 2 7)
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
(+ 1 8)
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9

This is one is linearly iterative as there are 2 state variables a and being
which are all that are needed at any moment to finish the process
