WITH NORmal order evaluation
test 0 p will become
  (if (= 0 0)
      0
      p))
then since 0=0 the conesequent expression
0 will be evaluated

with 


with applicative order evaluation
the definiton of test is substiteud
to yield

if (= 0 0)
    0
    (p))

p is substituded as p

but that doesnt really change anything
it shud still evaluate to 0...? 

# so actually p keeps expanding to itself which cauess a uk so on dead loop type of thing
#otherwise answer is fine
