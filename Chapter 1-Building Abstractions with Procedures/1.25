Im kinda stukc I feel like her solution is better
I dont understand why in the orignal expmod you keep putting the remainder
again as again as you recurse through the procedure so i am tracing it

(expmod 3  4  5)
(remainder (square (expmod 3 2 5)) 5)
(remainder (square (remainder(square(expmod 3 1 5)) 5))5)
(remainder (square (remainder(square(remainder (* 3 (expmod 3 0 5)) 5) 5))5)
(remainder (square (remainder(square(remainder (* 3 1) 5) 5))5)
(remainder (square (remainder(square(remainder 3 5) 5))5)
(remainder (square (remainder 9 5))5)
(remainder (square 4)5)
(remainder 16 5)
1

New definition
expmod 3 4 5
remainder 81 5
1

So yes this system also works


------------------
Okay so what happened what is that even though her thing is techincally correct
Her method of using fast-expt brings in much larger numbers into play 
The remainder in the orignal expmod keeps the numbers small and simple-ish
Which means that her method takes more computaional resources and time
