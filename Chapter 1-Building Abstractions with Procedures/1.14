Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the
count-change procedure of section 1.2.2 in making change 
for 11 cents. 
What are the orders of growth of the space and number 
of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed
increases?

space
As you increase amount the space needed grows linearly
because you have to do a constant number of more steps 
to break down the number. 

So its order of growth is 
0(n)

steps
If you increase the ammount there will be more steps required
to break it down and if you increase the denominations you will need alot more splits
after calculations its 0(n^k)

Lots of math required for steps quite interesting
